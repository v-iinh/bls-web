## About

The Boston Latin School Web Development Club is a space for BLS scholars to explore and learn about front-end web development. A revival of the original web development club, which ceased operations after senior members graduated, our hope is to provide the resources necessary for scholars to build their own portfolios, games, websites, and ultimately, to act as a community that collaborates to educate students about web development. Whether you are a complete beginner or an experienced programmer, all are welcome!
